Hardware:the hardware is very important for the computer it helps develop certain catagories,websites of the computer and other devices.
Input:an input converts physical input to binary information every device we use has inputs.the computer,phone has different types of inputs keyboards,touch pads.
Cpu:Central processing unit calculates information.The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results.
Output:Converts information to physical output.A standard output device is the computer monitor, which displays text, images.
IEEE is the institute of Electral and Electronic Engineers.The purpose of IEEE is for engineers,scientists to come together and develop new tools programs for different technology.
Executive summary 
My executive summary is that all of these tools are important for great use of technology,devices all over the world.these are great tools to help develop websites,programs.
the Hardware,input,output,cpu are key contributors for all devices running well every single of these tools are important for keyboards,touch pads,display,text,images to be a great resource to use for your computer,phones.
