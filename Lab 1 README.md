 executive summary 
 Jeffrey weaver
 this is my executive summary 
 the purpose of github is to help with IT 1025 and other classes you may have it supposed to help you with your assignments,turning them in and making it easier to get work done.
 github is a great idea because you can invite your teacher so they can look at your assignments and tell you what you need to improve on so they can help if you are having trouble.
IT is a great business for people who like technology and who wants to learn more about it you can learn how to use computers better how to develop websites and programs IT history is great and interesting to learn.
